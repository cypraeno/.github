## Hi there 👋
### Welcome to **Cypraeno**!

Astro-Monkeys is the home for the Caitlyn MCRT Renderer, a ray-tracer written in C++ developed by our RenderTeam. This organization aims to continue growing in members and projects, and we welcome anyone interested in any projects we may be doing to reach out!
If you want to look into developing for [Caitlyn](https://github.com/Astro-Monkeys/caitlyn), you can check out the wiki aimed for developers. It is open source, and we're always looking for help on moving it forward.
